# 04 - Types of data structures
## Linear and non linear data structures

##### Linear Data structures

> When all elements are arranged in a linear (sequential) order
> When each element has one predecessor element and one successor element

Examples : Array , Queue , Linked list , Stack

##### Non-linear Data structures

> when all elements are **NOT** arranged in a linear (sequential) order. There's no linear arrangement of the elements
> When each element may have more than one predecessor element and more than one successor element

Examples : Tree, Graph
## Static and dynamic data structures

##### Static Data structures

> Memory is allocated at compile time
> Maximum size is fixed

*Fast access*
*Slower insertion and deletion*

Example Array
##### Dynamic Data structures
> Memory is allocated at run time
> Maximum size is flexible

*Slower access*
*Faster insertion and deletion*

Example Linked list
